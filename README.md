# Mainline kernel 5.6.y

This is the mainline kernel 5.6.y for BananaPi M2 Zero and NanoPi Neo Air.
DTS for each board follow the board name convention which i find it more usefull.

# ChangeLog

* add support for BananaPi M2Z
* add support for NanoPi Neo Air (old revision)
* add support for Bluetooth
* add Kernel 5.6.0-rc4
* add Kernel 5.6.0-rc5

# ToDo

This kernel is based on mainline kernel and some hacks plus latest patch / fix from some kernel developers.
The kernel configuration may not be the ideal for some tasks.

* find the best kernel configuration (optimize)
* test the OV5640 sensor (quality)
* stress testing
* stability testing
* keep the kernel up to date

# Acknoledgments 

I would like to thank FriendlyElec and Foxconn (BPI) for the boards.
